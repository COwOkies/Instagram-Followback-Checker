# Instagram-Followback-Checker

For this program to work, you have to provide two files and then run the "check.py" file.
The 2 files you have to provide are "following.csv" and "follower.csv".

You can get csv files of followers/following with a chrome addon named "Insfo" (chrome link : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/insfo-export-instagram-fo/bckleejkdhlponanidmjfjdigpahlado)
